      - Hello there.
      - 'I was a medium in my life too by the way. '
      - It's not like I just decided I can interpret the weave of fate.
      - It takes many years to reach this level of expertise.
    - lines:
      - Actually, I knew more that most about what comes after.
      - I didn't expect it to be quite so... violent.
      - I must say, you are quite brave to go risking it out there.
      - Always so sure that no matter how much of a beating you take you'll come
        right back.
    - lines:
      - I wonder what those feral spirits feel out there?
      - Nothing at all perhaps?
  - dialogues:
    - lines:
      - 'Whoa! '
      - Sorry, you caught me lost in thought.
      - I've been going through those readings you gave me.
      - You are quite unafraid of anything it seems!
      - Don't you wonder what happens if you- No, nevermind.
      - You just keep up the good work.
    - lines:
      - I've discovered something, I'm not sure if you were aware.
      - 'This is but a transitionary place, a space between life and death. '
      - The implications of this, I am sure you understand, are confounding.
      - Here I was thinking that we had solved one of the great mysteries of life
        and death, and now we are shrouded in doubt once again.
    - lines:
      - I suppose this world is better then the alternative.
      - 'Great, endless darkness... '
      - Even the pain of life is a price worth paying for the privilege of existence.
  - dialogues:
    - lines:
      - Being that this is only a- a corridor between spaces neccessitates the fact
        that we must move on to the next place!
      - I've seen it, haven't you?
      - Spirits only linger here for a time, and then they leave.
      - Poof! Where do they go?
    - lines:
      - 'How can you head out there without the slightest inkling of what comes next? '
      - 'Oblivion could be lurking around any corner! '
      - I-I don't understand.
      - I don't understand any of you.
    - lines:
      - Ah, hello my friend.
      - I probably seem a little jumpy lately.
      - I've had to consider many things.
      - 'In life I always wanted to know what happened next. '
      - When my readings indicated the worst, I shrank from everything and everyone
        in fear.
      - Recently here I have felt somewhat the same.
      - It matters not, let's continue.
  giveQuest:
  - lines:
    - Um, excuse me, but could I ask you for a favour?
    - I would most certainly offer payment in return.
    - You see, I would rather like to record some readings from you to get a better
      understanding of the destiny landscape around here.
    - It would involve some reverse karmic movements however, no easy task.
    - What do you say?
  - lines:
    - Hello, it's that time again.
    - Our last experiment only revealed more questions I am afraid.
    - 'I must ask you to swim against the karmic current again. '
    - 'The ripples you form will hopefully illuminate the true nature of what lies
      before us. '
  - lines:
    - I've realised some things since our last collaboration.
    - There is little that readings can do to solve a problem such as we face as
      spirits.
    - All the same, there is one last thing I'd like from you.
    - A final reading of specific type; Death.
    - For  only once something has ended can something new begin.
  recieveHandIn:
  - lines:
    - Hm, interesting.
    - You have some strange effects on the weave of fate I must say.
    - Thank you.
  - lines:
    - 'How, unexciting. '
    - Sorry.
    - You've done an excellent job.
    - Please accept my thanks.
  - lines:
    - Excellent, then we are finished.
    - I don't need to check; the reading is inconclusive, as they always were.
    - Good work my friend.

    - AH!
    - Oh! It's just you.
    - Sorry, I'm feeling a little jumpy
    - What were we talking about?
  - lines:
    - Oh this is today?
    - I thought we were yesterday and this was happening next week
    - Confusing?
    - Quite clear I think.
  - lines:
    - I don't know how you stand it
    - Out there amongst all those... things.
    - Yuck.
    - Anyway, lets see what's ahead.
